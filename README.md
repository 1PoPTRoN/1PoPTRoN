Hey Folks!

I dont learn systems, I break them until they make senses to me.

`Living on Arch Linux.` <br>
`Hackintosh when I feel lazy.` <br>
`Open-source enjoyer, low-level curious.` <br>

### > Stack & Tools
- OS: **Arch Linux** (btw) and Windows <smtimes, trust me>
- Langs: `.c` `.bash` `.cpp` `.py` `.asm`
- Webs: `.html` `.css` `.js`
- Tools: Git, Ghostty

### > Messing with
- Linux internals & kernel concepts
- Hackintosh EFI tuning(AMD) when lazy
- Performance > aesthetics (btw both matters)
- College stuff (ik its boring af)

### > Talk to me about
- Linux rabbit holes
- Hackintosh pain & wins
- Open-source, systems, tooling
- Why minimal setups hit different

> “If it works, ill optimize it.  
> If it breaks, ill learn from it.”
