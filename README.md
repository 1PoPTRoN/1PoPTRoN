Hey Folks!

I don’t learn systems, I break them until they make senses to me.

```
Living on Arch Linux.
Hackintosh when I feel lazy.
Open-source enjoyer, low-level curious.
```

### > Stack & Tools
- OS: **Arch Linux** (btw) and Windows <smtimes, trust me>
- Langs: `.c` `.bash` `.cpp` `.py` `.asm`
- Web: `.html` `.css` `.js`
- Tools: Git, Ghostty, 

### > Messing with
- Linux internals & kernel concepts
- Hackintosh EFI tuning (AMD)
- Performance > aesthetics (btw both matters)
- College stuff (ik its boring af)

### > Talk to me about
- Linux rabbit holes
- Hackintosh pain & wins
- Open-source, systems, tooling
- Why minimal setups hit different
